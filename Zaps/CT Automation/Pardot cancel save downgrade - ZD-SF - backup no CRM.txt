                An indivdual cancellation has been processed by the Pardot -> SF automation for:

                Email: Step 2 Member Email

                IMPORTANT:  This member could not be matched to a Salesforce record, possibly because the email is different. As a result, no automated actions have been taken in the contact record. 

                First step:
                -- Find the correct contact record in SF

                What needs to be done in Stripe:
                - Delete the member's existing plan in Stripe
                - Add the "Monthly No Sharing Plan - $19/mo" 
                - If switching from an annual or quarterly, trial out the plan until the member's renewal date

                What needs to be done in ZD:
                - Add public comment to member confirming that they are now on the $4/mo plan, and informing them that they won't be eligible to share their app.
                - Close ticket

                What needs to be done in SF:
                - Set the "downgrade status" field to "(3) Member notified"
                - Set the "downgraded?" checkbox to checked

                What needs to be done in App Admin:
                - Reset EasyText keyword to generic pattern (subdomain + 3 numbers) if premium subscription was included
