                An individual cancellation has been processed by the Pardot -> SF automation for:

                Name: Step 2 Member Firstname Step 2 Member Last Name
                Email: Step 2 Member Email

                IMPORTANT:  This member could not be matched to a Salesforce record, probably because the email is different. As a result, no automated actions have been taken in the contact record. 

                What needs to be done:
                1. Find the correct contact record in SF
                2. Check requested Cancellation button 
                3. Set status to Cancelled
                4. Populate cancellation date
                5. Enter correct Paid Subscription End Date
                6. Save SF contact record
                7. Add a new task in SF that references this ZD ticket#
                8. Check Stripe record to see if subscriptions have been removed correctly
                9. Issue any refund if eligible
                10. Reset EasyText keyword to generic pattern (subdomain + 3 numbers) if premium subscription was included
