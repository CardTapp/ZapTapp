                Todo:
                ----------
                Stripe Record:
                (1) Open stripe record and add the correct state within the description.
                (2a) If the billing state is Washington, run an additional manual charge for 10% of the base charge amount.
                (2b) If the billing state is WA, change the subscription plan to include 10% sales tax next year.

                Contact Record:
                (1) Look up the customer email+cell from SSU form in SF contacts. If a record exists, great! If not, create a new contact record.
                (2) Refer to campaign creation form to update record appropriately -
                ie. Branch/DBA, contact owner, lead source, etc.
                (3) If the subscription type includes premium features, add a subscription add-on child record to the contact record. (Reference campaign creation form to confirm)
                (4) Attach the self signup record to the Contact record.
                (5) -- NEW -- If the subscription involves a trial, enter the Stripe trial end date into the Contact Record Paid Subscription Start Date field

                App Creation (if no app pre-provisioned):
                ((NOTE: If app exists already, skip to #3 here and then final steps below))  
                (1) Check that product name is accurate given the vertical you are provisioning on.
                (2) Provision the app with the appropriate template & subdomain. 
                (Reference campaign creation form for correct vertical, preferred subdomain & template)
                (3) Apply preferred keyword if applicable.

                Final Steps:
                (1) Add the stripe token above in App Admin.
                (2) Confirm paid subscription start date is populated/accurate.
                (3) Reference campaign creation form for preferred follow up.
